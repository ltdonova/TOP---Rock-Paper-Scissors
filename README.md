# TOP---Rock-Paper-Scissors

Update: The user can now play with buttons

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game that is played through the console. To play, in the console, type game(). From there you will be prompt to enter rock/paper/scissor. The game is first to 5 wins. Results are printed to the console. 

In the future to improve on the project, a UI should be further developed with styling. Additionally, some conditionals might be able to be shortened.
